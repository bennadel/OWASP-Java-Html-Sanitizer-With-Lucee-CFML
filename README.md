# Running OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer With Lucee CFML 5.3.7.48

This is an experiment in using the [OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer project][owasp] with Lucee CFML. It allows you take untrusted HTML input (ie, user generated content) and create trusted, safe-to-use HTML output. The primary concern here is removing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
